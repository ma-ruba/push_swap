# push_swap
The goal of this project is to write a sorting algorithm "push_swap" which uses 2 stacks (A and B)\
and 11 types of certain operations. This task is solved with the help of quick sort algorithm.\
As an argument program receives a .txt file whith the range of integers. This range is a content\
of the stack A. Stack B is initially empty. (Term 'stack'is used in a different kind than usually assumed).
